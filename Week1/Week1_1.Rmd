This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear in the notebook. 

You can click *Knit* to execute all code or you can select the code you want to execute and press *Control+Enter*. 

This might be your first time working with R, or even first time working with a computer programming language. Don't worry! We will start from the very basics.

## R Basics

R is a programming language widely used for data analysis. R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. Almost everything in R is an object. We can assign value 2 to an object `a` (or we can call `a` as a variable) as:

```{r}
a = 2
```

In Rstudio, you will see the object `a` appears on the upper right panel. We can also type the name of the object to check the value stored:

```{r}
a 
```

## Functions

Data analysis involves the application of a series of functions to the data. We will study and use many complicated functions in this course, but for now let's do something simple: Take the logarithm of `a` and store it in a variable `b`:

```{r}
b = log(a)
b
```

In general, many functions in R are predefined and we use parentheses to evaluate a function, just as calling `log()` in our example. Most predefined functions have built-in help page. If we want to know how to call `log` function, we can simply type `?log`. A help page will appear in the botton-right panel and we can see that "The general form log(x, base) computes logarithms with base base", where "x is a numeric or complex vector and base is a positive or complex number with defaults to $e$". 

Now back to our case, we want to compute $log_e(2)$. Since the base argument was set to $e$ by default, we only need to pass the value 2 as the `x` argument to the function. 

```{r}
log(x=a)
log(a) # function implicitly assumes the first argument is x
log(2) # because a = 2
```

If you don't know the name of the function, you can ask ChatGPT for help. For example, suppose we want to take exponential of `b`, a quick search found out that `exp` is the desired function. 

```{r}
exp(b)
```

## Data types

Variables in R have different data types. Data types are basic building blocks of advanced data analysis. We can use the function `class` to check the data type of variables. Three basic data types are numeric, character, and logical.

### Numeric

```{r}
a = 2
class(a)
```

### Character

```{r}
a = "Biostatistics"
class(a)
```

### Logical
```{r}
a = TRUE # Note that there is no double quote
class(a)
a = FALSE
class(a)
```

### Vector

We can create a vector of variables with same data type using function `c()`.

```{r}
a = c(1,2,3) # or a = 1:3
b = c("Biostatistics","Genetics","Computer Science")
d = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```

Alternatively, you can also use function `rep()` or `seq()` to generate sequence with specific patterns. You will experiment with these functions in your homework.

Below are different ways to subset a vector:

```{r}
b[1] # R is 1-based 
b[1:2] 
b[c(1,3)]
```

We can also subset a vector based on a logical vector:

```{r}
d = b %in% c("Biostatistics","Genetics")
b[d]
```

### List

Unlike vector, you can store any combination of variables with different data types using List.

```{r}
a = list(student=1, course="Biostatistics", pass=TRUE)
class(a)
```

Below are two most commonly used ways to subset a list:

```{r}
a[[2]] # subset by index
a$student # subset by name
```

### Factors

Factors are useful to store categorical data. Compared with a vector, factor has another vector called *levels* to store the unique values of categories. Factors are useful for numerical summary or visualization by categories as we will see later in this course.

```{r}
a = c("Pass","Pass","Fail","Fail")
levels = c("Pass","Fail")
d = factor(a, levels)
d
```

### Matrices

Matrices are two-dimensional generalization of numeric vector to have rows and columns. As you will see in the later part of the course, matrices are commonly used to represent numerical data in the biological sciences. Here, we just give a brief introduction:

```{r}
a = matrix(1:6, 2, 3, byrow=T) 
#a = matrix(1:6, 2, 3, byrow=F)
a[1,2] # subset one element
a[1,] # subset one row
a[,1] # subset one column
a[c(1,2),c(1,2)] # subset by rows and columns
```

### Data frames

Data frames are similar to Matrices but are not limited to storing numerical data only. We can think of data frames as tables with rows representating observations and columns representing different variables. Below is a toy example: 

```{r}
a = data.frame(courses=c("Biostatistics","Genetics","Computer Science"), grades=c(90,90,50))
a

# subset data frames just like matrices
a[1,1]
a[1,]

# create a logical vector of whether passing the course
a$pass = a$grades > 60
a

# subset to by a logical vector
a[a$grades > 60,]$courses # or a$courses[a$grades > 60]
```
